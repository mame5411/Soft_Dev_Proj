# Soft_Dev_Proj
This is a repository for our groups project for Software Development. More specifically, Our resume builder application.

This project asks the user to buld an account and fill it with information. The user can use this info to build a script that is used on over leaf to create a pdf version of their resume. To retrieve this information they must signup on the website and log in. 

The milestone 3 folder holds files related to our mock up website representing what our goals would be for our finished project.
The Website and website folders contain broken projects due to discrepancies between specific machines.
The official final project is the web folder. It holds the node modules, the LaTex templates, and the server.js file. 
There are ejs files for the main page, the login, the signup, the generate, profile and results pages insie of the views folder withhin the web folder.
